# Android SSH Proxy

Android application (Android 10+) for system-wide HTTP traffic proxying through an SSH local port-forwarding tunnel using `VpnService.setHttpProxy`.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **üöÄ System-wide HTTP/HTTPS Proxy:** Tunnels all HTTP/HTTPS traffic through an SSH server.
*   **üîë Secure Key Management:** Generates and stores SSH keys securely using the Android Keystore.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Host Key Verification:** Protects against MITM attacks by verifying server host keys.
*   **üîÑ Automatic Reconnection:** Automatically reconnects to the server with an exponential backoff strategy.
*   **üß™ Connection Quality Monitoring:** Monitors connection latency and quality in real-time.
*   **üåê "Test All Servers" Feature:** Tests the latency of all configured servers.
*   **‚úÖ "Test Connection" without VPN:** Allows testing the internet connection without an active VPN.
*   **üì± Multi-language Support:** Available in English and Russian.
*   **üé® Themes:** Supports system, light, and dark themes.

## üì± How to Use

1.  **üì≤ Install the application** on an Android 10+ device.
2.  **üîë On the first launch:**
    *   The application will automatically generate a new SSH key pair.
    *   Copy the public key from the setup wizard or the "Keys" section.
3.  **üìã Provide the public key** to your server administrator to add it to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
4.  **üåê Add your server:**
    *   Go to the "Servers" section and click the "+" button.
    *   Enter your server's details (name, host, port, and username).
5.  **üîå Connect:**
    *   Select your server from the list and tap the "Connect" button.
    *   Grant VPN permission to the application.
    *   Wait for the status to change to "Connected".
6.  **‚úÖ Done!** All your HTTP/HTTPS traffic is now routed through your SSH server.

## üîß Server Setup (for Administrators)

To set up your own proxy server, you can use the provided setup script in the "Instructions" section of the app. The script will automatically:

*   Create a restricted user for SSH tunneling.
*   Install and configure Tinyproxy as the HTTP proxy.
*   Set up the SSH key for authentication.
*   Restrict the user's access to only local port-forwarding.

**Server Structure:**

```bash
# Restricted user
/home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys  # Your public key

# HTTP proxy (Tinyproxy) listening on 127.0.0.1:8118
# SSH forwarding: phone:8080 -> server:8118
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   The user has minimal privileges (port-forwarding only).
*   The proxy is only accessible locally (127.0.0.1).
*   SSH keys are encrypted using the Android Keystore (AES-256-GCM).
*   Host keys are validated to prevent MITM attacks.
*   IPv6 is supported to prevent VPN bypass.

## üîê Security Features

### Private Key Encryption

*   **Android Keystore:** All private keys are encrypted and stored in the Android Keystore.
*   **AES-256-GCM:** Modern symmetric encryption is used.
*   **TEE/Secure Element:** Encryption keys are protected at the hardware level.
*   **Zero-knowledge:** Private keys cannot be extracted, even with root access.

### Host Key Validation (Known Hosts)

*   **Automatic Saving:** Host keys are automatically saved on the first connection.
*   **SHA-256 Fingerprints:** Servers are identified by their SHA-256 fingerprints.
*   **MITM Protection:** The connection is blocked if the host key changes.
*   **User Confirmation:** A dialog is shown to the user to accept host key changes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

*   **HTTP Proxy Only:** The application does not modify HTTPS/TLS traffic directly and relies on system support for proxying.
*   **Android 10+ Required:** The `setHttpProxy` API is only available on Android 10 and above.
*   **No Per-app Exclusions:** The VPN is configured without routes, and the HTTP proxy is applied globally.
*   **Server Script:** The server setup script requires root/sudo privileges and should be reviewed before execution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
# or
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## üêõ Debugging

```bash
# Main components
adb logcat -s SshProxyService AppLog ConnectionHealthMonitor

# Security
adb logcat -s SecureHostKeyVerifier KnownHostsManager KeystoreManager

# Ping and IP monitoring
adb logcat -s PingMonitor IpLocationService

# All application components
adb logcat | grep -E "(SshProxy|SSH|VPN|Ping|android-ssh-proxy)"
```
